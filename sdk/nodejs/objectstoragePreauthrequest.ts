/**
 * This resource provides the Preauthenticated Request resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage service.
 *
 * Creates a pre-authenticated request specific to the bucket.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testPreauthenticatedRequest = new oci.ObjectstoragePreauthrequest("testPreauthenticatedRequest", {
 *     accessType: _var.preauthenticated_request_access_type,
 *     bucket: _var.preauthenticated_request_bucket,
 *     namespace: _var.preauthenticated_request_namespace,
 *     timeExpires: _var.preauthenticated_request_time_expires,
 *     bucketListingAction: _var.preauthenticated_request_bucket_listing_action,
 *     object: _var.preauthenticated_request_object,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * PreauthenticatedRequests can be imported using the `id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import oci:index/objectstoragePreauthrequest:ObjectstoragePreauthrequest test_preauthenticated_request "n/{namespaceName}/b/{bucketName}/p/{parId}"
 * ```

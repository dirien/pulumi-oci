 * This data source provides details about a specific Authentication Policy resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity service.

 * Gets the authentication policy for the given tenancy. You must specify your tenant’s OCID as the value for

 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testAuthenticationPolicy = oci.GetIdentityAuthenticationPolicy({
 *     compartmentId: _var.tenancy_ocid,
 * });
 * ```

/**
 * This data source provides details about a specific Host Scan Target resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vulnerability Scanning service.
 *
 * Retrieves a HostScanTarget identified by the target ID. A host scan target is a collection of compute instances that you want routinely scanned for security vulnerabilities.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testHostScanTarget = oci.GetVulnerabilityScanningHostScanTarget({
 *     hostScanTargetId: oci_vulnerability_scanning_host_scan_target.test_host_scan_target.id,
 * });
 * ```

/**
 * This data source provides the list of Policies in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Identity service.
 *
 * Lists the policies in the specified compartment (either the tenancy or another of your compartments).
 * See [Where to Get the Tenancy's OCID and User's OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#five).
 *
 * To determine which policies apply to a particular group or compartment, you must view the individual
 * statements inside all your policies. There isn't a way to automatically obtain that information via the API.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testPolicies = oci.GetIdentityPolicies({
 *     compartmentId: _var.tenancy_ocid,
 *     name: _var.policy_name,
 *     state: _var.policy_state,
 * });
 * ```

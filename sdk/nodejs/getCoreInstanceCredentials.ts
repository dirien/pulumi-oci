/**
 * This data source provides details about a specific Instance Credential resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.
 *
 * Gets the generated credentials for the instance. Only works for instances that require a password to log in, such as Windows.
 * For certain operating systems, users will be forced to change the initial credentials.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testInstanceCredential = oci.GetCoreInstanceCredentials({
 *     instanceId: oci_core_instance.test_instance.id,
 * });
 * ```

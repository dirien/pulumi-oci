/**
 * This data source provides the list of Volume Backup Policy Assignments in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.
 *
 * Gets the volume backup policy assignment for the specified volume. The
 * `assetId` query parameter is required, and the returned list will contain at most
 * one item, since volume can only have one volume backup policy assigned at a time.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as oci from "@pulumi/oci";
 *
 * const testVolumeBackupPolicyAssignments = oci.GetCoreVolumeBackupPolicyAssignments({
 *     assetId: oci_core_volume.test_volume.id,
 * });
 * ```
